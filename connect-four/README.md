I modified code from this [repository](https://github.com/apksqrd/Connect-4/tree/main/Connect4).
I was originally going to remake connect four from scratch for the 3rd (maybe 4th) time, to optimize every little thing, but I realized that it doesn't matter because it is Java on the web, and it is going to be super slow anyways.

Google's inspect element groups console logs by default.
To disable this, uncheck `Group similar messages in console` in the settings.
